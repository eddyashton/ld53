# Poppycock's Perfect Packages

Made in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 53 (theme `Delivery`), in Pico-8.

## Story

You have just been hired by a global megacorporation.

Yesterday, the CEO Winston Poppycock announced his latest triumph: a fleet of fully autonomous self-driving delivery vehicles.

That was a lie.

The vehicles are remote-controlled, by you.

Place arrows to direct the vehicles. Collect orders from the depot, and deliver them to the homes of eager consumers. Don't let the backlog fill the depot, or you'll be fired.

## Controls

Move your cursor with the arrow keys.
Hold the X button (C on keyboard) to enter placement mode, and place arrows. Set the direction with an arrow key. Tap X with no direction to delete an existing arrow.
Press the O button (V on keyboard) to cycle through cursor colours, and then place arrows of each colour.
Trucks will only follow arrows of their own colour.
Drive past a depot or house to collect and deliver orders.
Windows light up in the colour of the good each customer has ordered.
Multiple orders can be collected delivered at once.

## Notes
- No audio! Maybe next time
- There are multiple levels availble from the pause menu
- Difficulty is a bit whack, as the levels are mostly aesthetic rather than fun. Very easy to add more though, maybe I'll do that after the jam
